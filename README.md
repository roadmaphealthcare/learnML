## learnML
A repository to share tutorials for learning machine learning methods in Python (don't waste your time with R; 
it is best suited to academia).

#### Association Rules 
Rule generation is a common task in the mining of frequent patterns. 
An **association rule** is an implication expression of the form X→Y, 
where X and Y are disjoint itemsets. 
A more concrete example based on consumer behaviour would be {Diapers}→{Beer} 
suggesting that people who buy diapers are also likely to buy beer.

#### Principal Components Analysis
**Principal Component Analysis** (PCA) is fundamentally a dimensionality reduction algorithm, but it can also be useful 
as a tool for visualization, for noise filtering, for feature extraction and engineering, and much more.
